1. Git Basic
	$ git init
	$ git add 
	$ git commit -m "message"
	$ git status
	# tell us the files conditions
	# example: On branch master
		Changes not staged for commit:
	  	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	  	(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

		modified:   VersionControlPractice.txt

		no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

	$ git diff
	# to compare working directory content with stage (content on stage is what has been added but not committed)

	$ git diff --cache
	# to compare stage with master

	$ git log
	# to check historical record of version control
	# example:

2. Reset to historical version
	2.1 HEAD point to current/latest version
		HEAD^: last version
		HEAD^^: last version of last version
		HEAD~n: last nth version

	2.2 git reset
		$ git reset --hard HEAD^ (parameter hard will be covered later)
		# reset current version to last version

		$ cat xxx.file
		# take a look at the file of latest version

		$ git reflog  # check all the historical versions
		$ git reset --hard commit_id
		# give us a chance to reset to any version before even we have reset to some older version
